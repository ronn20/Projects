I have worked with the strong lensing team at stony brook university under professor Simon Birrer to  create a SuperNova class for the sim-pipeline python package which is publicly accessible for gravitationally lensed data,computations, and projects. My job was to create a  SNe population class and Supernova catalog which can be utilized by accessing the sim pipeline package. I worked on this project for a semester  during my 2nd year of college.

Above are some sample graphs obtained by running the code package included in the branch. Yielding Star formation histories, and the number of Supernova, _Volumetrically_, as a function of redshift from the "beginning of time"
