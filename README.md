I will provide the calibration files for the Transit Lab here. The file is too large for Github too handle (300 Mb large) as it contains 300 photometric transit images as well as calibration images: 

[Transit Images Zip Folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkNFmQK4gyXTiGLTz-xGA0x_7Lsy9AX1/view?usp=sharing)

This contains:
- 300 photometric images in the blue band filter 
- different exposure dark images, 10 files per exposure. (.5 seconds, 2 seconds, 18 seconds) 
10 Flat Fields
